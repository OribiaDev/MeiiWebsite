            <b>Collection of Data:</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            The use of this application ("Bot") in a server requires the collection of
            some specific user and server data ("Data"). The Data collected includes, but is not
            limited to Discord server and channel ID values, and data collected for confession moderation purposes.
            Use of the Bot is considered an agreement to the terms of this Policy.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <b>Access to Data:</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            Access to Data is only permitted to Bot's developers, and only in the
            scope required for the development, moderation, testing, and implementation of
            features for the Bot. Data is not sold, provided to, or shared with any third
            party, except where required by law or a Terms of Service agreement. You
            can view the data upon request by adding <i>oribia.dev</i> on Discord or on our <Link to="/discord" className="GenericLinkDeco" id="PrivacyPLink">Support Server</Link>.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <b>Storage of Data:</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            Data is stored in a MongoDB database. The database is secured to prevent
            external access, however no guarantee is provided and the Bot owners
            assume no liability for the unintentional or malicious breach of Data. In
            the event of an unauthorised Data access, users will be notified through
            the Discord client application.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <b>Deletion of Data:</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            Data that is associated with a server is unrecoverably deleted when the Bot leaves that server or the
            data deletion command is used. Data that is saved for confession moderation purposes is deleted after
            30 days of the confession command being used. The bot owners assume no liability for the unintentional
            or intentional deletion of data. 
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <b>User Rights:</b>
          </p>
          <p>

            your Discord server or account. You may submit a request through the Discord <Link to="/discord" className="GenericLinkDeco" id="PrivacyPLink">Support Server</Link> or
